Really good for the price
Reviewed in India on 7 November 2025Colour: BlackVerified Purchase
Honest review , no promotion just an honest buyer1.The noise cancellation is really good , better than others for example when compared to JBl 770 NC just in case if you are wondering2.Sound quality is also very good and an equaliser is also there in the app so you can make adjustments to it , i personally love the bass booster3.And it is comfortable to wear,soft paddings, adjustable4.And transparency mode is good if you want to walk outside so that you are aware of the surroundingsIn total there is no such things to point out honestly cause even in low volume i can literally enjoy music very well as compared to earpods and others5. Easily connects to two devices like you won't even know when its connected it's that fast6. Design is not bad7. Soundcore app has great features even on the right ear cup all the buttons are there so no need to open app again and again to change settings or increase volumeDon't have anything else to sayWrote this review just in case you are confused about which one to buy , like I was confused between noise airmax5 jbl 770 nc and soundcoreGlad i bought this oneAnother suggestion. Try listening to 8D audio when you buy this  trust me it sounds amazing on this headphone

Premium Quality in budget
Reviewed in India on 27 November 2025Colour: BlackVerified Purchase
Sound and comfort are good. The plastic material feels like premium quality. It's just that if you are a first-time user of such headphones, then initially it might feel heavy, which is natural, but when you get used to it, I feel it won't be an issue compared to the quality you are getting. Overall, it's a good product in this price range. It doesn't feel cheap.

Ahk4.0 out of 5 stars
Good anc , amazing sound quality
Reviewed in India on 27 July 2024Colour: BlackVerified Purchase
Bought it 1 week ago , charged once , i use it hardly 2hrs a day with anc on all times, so didnt need to charge it again yet !! I use it in gym so sometime it slips while doing some exercises !! Anc is amazing as it blocks all the gym background noise of people talking , weights banging and gym speakers sound . Transparency mode is v bad as it ruins the sound quality !! Normal mode provides the best sound quality but it also reduces somewhat of the background noise !! 3.5mm cable provided in box is of low quality so i bought new ptron brand 3.5mm cable from amazon as i use it wired for gaming !! Works amazingly goood for gaming in WIRED MODE !! Also audio quality is far better in wired mode but theres no noise cancellation available in wired mode  !! Worth it for 3999/- A case for protecting those headphones shoudlve been provided as wireless headphones are fragile no matter what brand you buy !! Didnt choose its competitor Jbl660nc as that headphone doesnt have app support but soundcore headphone has a smooth helpful app . Also weight is less and connectivity issues are nonexistent !! You can go for it no doubtUpdate : 08-08-2024 . On 29th July , 2 days after recieving the product , wired mode stopped working , as i had bought other 3.5mm cable for it , it didnt work w the headphones , also the original cable also didnt work with the headphones !! i used both the cables with my redmi phone and both of them cables were working , so the headphones were at fault and werent working in wired mode !! so on 29th July itself i placed a REPLACEMENT ORDER . the replacement product shouldve arrived on 2nd JULY before 10PM . At 9;40pm on 2nd july i got a call from delivery agent saying his tire is punctured and that he cant come on 2nd july so he will come on 3rd july before afternoon !! He didnt come before afternoon and then stopped recieving my calls and then later marked the replacement as rejected by the customer FYI < I HAVENT REJECTED ANYTHING !! After this i have talked to 5 amazon representatives on helpline number who PROMISED ME that i will get my replacement on 4th July !! Ofc on 4th july again at 9:30PM i got call from AMAZON DELIVERY HEAD of our area saying that my package will arrive on 5th july !! and that lady called mansi who apparently works for amazon , right after the call ended she herself marked the replacement again as rejected by the customer !! this time i got v angry , i called helpline again , and this time they said that due to rejecting parcels many times, replacement cant occur and now i have to give it return and get refund !! thankfully i gave return and got refund on time !! but my point is , i have been prime member since 2019 and i havent ever recieved or faced such liar delivery agent and area head managers before !! they all lied and blamed it on me that im rejecting the parcels !! this is so wrong from amazon !! im not blaming anker at all , i have anker charger , charging cable and i know their after sales service is good and also the headphones can be faulty i accept , but amazon has ruined the experience for me !! now before buying any tech product from amazon ill think twice !!

Sound quality and noise cancellation is good. Lightweight and portable. Not comfortable to wear for long hours and causes pain in the ear when listened continuously. Mic does not work when connected via aux cable.
